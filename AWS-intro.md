üöÄ **Project Title & Tagline**
============================

**Project Name:** AWS Lambda Email Splitter
**Tagline:** A Python-based AWS Lambda function to split email addresses and transfer files between S3 buckets.

üìñ **Description**
---------------

The AWS Lambda Email Splitter is a Python-based serverless application that splits email addresses and transfers files between S3 buckets. This project utilizes AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and AWS IAM to provide a scalable and secure solution for email address processing and file transfer.

The application consists of a single AWS Lambda function, `lambda_function.py`, which takes an email address as input and splits it into the local part and the domain. The function then transfers the file to the specified S3 bucket. The file transfer process is facilitated by the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3).

‚ú® **Features**
--------------

1. **Email Address Splitting**: The Lambda function splits the input email address into the local part and the domain.
2. **File Transfer**: The Lambda function transfers the file to the specified S3 bucket.
3. **AWS Lambda Integration**: The application leverages AWS Lambda to provide a serverless computing environment.
4. **Amazon S3 Integration**: The application utilizes Amazon S3 to store and transfer files.
5. **AWS IAM Integration**: The application utilizes AWS IAM to provide secure access to AWS resources.
6. **Boto3 Integration**: The application utilizes the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services.
7. **Test Script**: The project includes a test script, `test_s3_script.py`, to test the Lambda function.
8. **Security**: The application uses AWS IAM to provide secure access to AWS resources and encrypts sensitive data.

üìÅ **Project Structure**
------------------------

* `lambda_function.py`: The main AWS Lambda function.
* `test_s3_script.py`: The test script for the Lambda function.
* `requirements.txt`: The dependencies required for the project.

‚öôÔ∏è **How to Run**
----------------

### Setup

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Create a new AWS Lambda function and upload the `lambda_function.py` file.
3. Configure the AWS Lambda function to use the `test_s3_script.py` file as the test script.

### Environment

* AWS Access Key ID: `<your-aws-access-key-id>`
* AWS Secret Access Key: `<your-aws-secret-access-key>`
* Source Bucket: `<your-source-bucket>`
* Destination Bucket: `<your-destination-bucket>`

### Build

1. Build the AWS Lambda function by uploading the `lambda_function.py` file to AWS Lambda.
2. Configure the AWS Lambda function to use the specified environment variables.

### Deploy

1. Deploy the AWS Lambda function to your desired environment.

üß™ **Testing Instructions**
---------------------------

1. Run the `test_s3_script.py` file using the AWS CLI or your preferred testing tool.
2. Verify that the Lambda function splits the email address correctly and transfers the file to the specified S3 bucket.
